Once upon a time there was a guy named Randy. Randy lived in a small village called Repoville. Randy loved everything about his life except for one thing. His village never has enough food. 
Randy now have 50% off coupon on KFC. Randy no more hungry. Randy became fat.
Randy was not a big guy. In fact, he was a rather compact fellow. This however did not reflect the size of his appetite in the slightest; he could wolf down a meal in no time flat. This big appetite of his often bothered his neighbors in Repoville because the town's situation did not permit such a laissez-faire attitude towards their meals. Yes!
